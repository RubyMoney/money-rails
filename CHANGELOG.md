## 1.9.0

- Allow the use of money-rails with plan ActiveRecord (without Rails)
- Remove translation of postfix for the amount column (always use _cents by default)
- Push Monetize dependency from 1.6.0 to 1.7.0

## 1.8.0

- Ruby 2.4 support
- Upgrade Money dependency from 6.7 to 6.8.1
- Upgrade Monetize dependency from 1.4.0 to 1.6.0
- Raise `MoneyRails::Error` instead of exposing Money and Monetize errors

## 1.7.0

- Do not convert Mongoid money fields from nil to zero
- Refactor `#monetize` method

## 1.6.2

- Fix attribute order possibly affecting the value of monetized attribute
- Add support for RailsAdmin (use :money type)
- Raise error when gem was unable to infer monetized attribute name
- Revert decimal mark and thousands separator addtion, since formatting should depend on country and locale, instead of currency

## 1.6.1

- View helper now respects currency decimal mark and thousands separator
- Fix error when monetizing with attribute's name
- Fix mime-types dependency issue with ruby 1.9
- Fix issue with gem not updating automatically inferred currency column

## 1.6.0

## 1.5.0

- Respect Money.use_i18n when validating.
- Include attribute in validation messages like Rails does.
- Respect `raise_error_on_money_parsing` before raising a MoneyRails::ActiveRecord::Monetizable::ReadOnlyCurrencyException.

## 1.4.1

 - validator was looking for monetizable_attributes using a symbol key, when the keys are all strings. Asserted string key values in rspec and changed validator to look for a string key.
 - make monetized_attribute hash comparison order independent
 - Isolate class used for the monetized_attributes tests to prevent cross-contamination
 - rename `format_with_settings` method to `format`
 - add gem tasks

## 1.4.0

- Fix validation failing when both superclass and subclass use monetize macros and any of them validates any field
- Extract db adapter without open connection on load
- Add support for field currency values to be determined by lambda.
- Simplify validation options
- Test for skipping validations separately from each other
- Instead of requiring either the PG version or the non, always require the PG version and only fail to require the non when using PG, that way monetize will always work and money is supported for backwards compat. This way you can have a system with sqlite for dev and pg for production, for instance, and things still work.
- Refactor monetized_attributes
- updating db/schema.rb
- DRYing migration extensions
- Testing against latest ruby version
- Include postgres specific code also when adaptor = postgis.
