# Debugging Gemstash

If you are finding Gemstash isn’t behaving as you would expect, you
might want to start by looking at the server log. You can find the log
at `server.log` within your base directory. By default, this will be at
`~/.gemstash/server.log`.

You might find it easier to view the log directly in your terminal. If
you run Gemstash [in non-daemonized form](gemstash-start.1.md#options),
the log will be output directly to standard out:

    $ gemstash start --no-daemonize

You can also [check the status](gemstash-status.1.md) of the server:

    $ gemstash status

The server status is checked by passing through to
[pumactl](https://github.com/puma/puma#pumactl).

If you find a bug, please don’t hesitate to [open a bug
report](https://github.com/bundler/gemstash#contributing)\!
